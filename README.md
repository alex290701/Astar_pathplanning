# Astar_pathplanning

```
roslaunch find_path Astar_navigation.launch
```

Once the Rviz starts you can provide the start point with 2D pose estimate and end point with 2D navgoal. You can visualize the generated path.

**Note:** Please make sure both the points are inside the map.
Feel free to try any other maze maps if you could.
